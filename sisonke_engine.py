sisonke_engine.py
==================

All the math for the Sisonke Football Predictive Terminal, kept
completely separate from the Streamlit UI so it can be tested directly
with plain Python (no Streamlit needed to verify the numbers are right).

DESIGN DECISIONS WORTH KNOWING ABOUT (documented up front because this
is a real-money-adjacent tool and every assumption should be visible,
not buried):

1. HOME ADVANTAGE IS NOT DOUBLE-COUNTED. Host stats are computed ONLY
   from a team's home matches, and visitor stats ONLY from their away
   matches - so whatever real home boost a team gets is already baked
   into their host numbers. No separate home-advantage multiplier is
   applied anywhere in this file.

2. TEAM STRENGTH NEVER COMES FROM A TEAM'S OWN RAW GOALS. The
   attack/defense STRENGTH RATIOS that differentiate one team from
   another are built entirely from territory metrics (big chances,
   shots on target, box touches) - never from a team's own win/loss
   record or their own average goals, which is exactly the "luck"
   signal the spec says to avoid. The one place raw goals appear at all
   is as a single LEAGUE-WIDE average goals figure used as a shared
   baseline unit (the same number for every team in that league) to
   convert relative territory strength into an actual expected-goals
   scale for the Poisson math - since "big chances" has no absolute
   goals unit on its own. That's a scale anchor, not a team signal.

3. PROBABILITIES ARE ALWAYS COMPUTED, NEVER FIXED. Every tactical
   multiplier in Section 6 only ever adjusts the INPUT attack/defense
   rates that feed the Dixon-Coles and Monte Carlo engines. The actual
   market probabilities always come out of real Poisson math or a real
   10,000-run simulation - a slider never directly sets a probability
   or an EV number by formula shortcut.

4. RHO (the Dixon-Coles low-score correlation parameter) is fitted from
   the league's own historical low-score frequencies, not a fixed
   constant - see fit_rho().

5. The half-life for time-decay weighting is chosen by actually
   backtesting candidate half-lives against real past results with a
   Brier score (see optimize_half_life()) - not asserted as a fixed
   number, unless you tick "Freeze Decay" for a fixed 45-day window.

    REALISM NOTE (checked against actual research, not assumed):
    - New manager bounce: Premier League data (2021/22-2025/26, 35
      mid-season appointments) shows clubs jumping from ~0.90 to ~1.27
      points per game in the first 5 games under a new manager - a ~41%
      relative swing. That number is intentionally NOT applied at full
      strength here: most of it is regression to the mean (clubs sack
      managers exactly when results are at their worst, so ANY manager
      would see some bounce-back), plus small-sample noise that fades by
      games 11-20. A conservative 10% attack/defense bump is kept as a
      defensible middle estimate of the sustained part of the effect,
      not the full raw PPG swing.
    - Striker vs defender injuries are now DIFFERENT, not the same
      checkbox: losing a primary goal-scorer is a fairly predictable,
      attack-specific quality loss. Losing a first-choice center-back
      tends to show up more as increased defensive VARIANCE (makeshift
      back-lines make more individual errors) on top of a quality loss -
      this matches the general direction of the injury-performance
      literature (Hägglund et al. 2013, BJSM; and follow-up Bundesliga
      cost studies) even though no single published number cleanly
      separates "striker" vs "defender" effect size - these remain
      reasoned estimates, not a proven precise coefficient.
    - Key player transfer impact (signing arrived / departed) is
      DELIBERATELY a manual slider, not a fixed checkbox constant like
      the others above. Unlike a manager change (which has multi-season
      league-wide PPG data to check against), a transfer's real impact
      depends enormously on the specific player's quality, position, and
      how good their replacement is - there's no single defensible
      universal percentage the way there arguably is for the other
      toggles. Forcing a fixed number here would be less honest, not
      more precise, so this is left to your own judgement per case.
